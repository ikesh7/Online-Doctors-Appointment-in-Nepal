# Healthcare System

This is a modern Healthcare System web application built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI components, Clerk, Prisma ORM, and a PostgreSQL database. The system is designed to streamline hospital management operations, providing features like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), appointment scheduling, laboratory management, staff management, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- npm or yarn
- Cloud-based PostgreSQL Database (e.g., Supabase, Neon, or similar)
- Clerk account for user management

### Installation

1. **Open the zip file:**

   ```
   Unzip and open the file in any code editor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**
   Create a `.env` or rename `.env.example` file in the root of the project and add the following:

   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your clerk publishable key
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=clerk secrek key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
    DATABASE_URL="postgres database url"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=cloudinary cluster name for image uploading
   ```

Replace the placeholders with your cloud-based PostgreSQL credentials and Clerk keys. For Clerk, you can find these keys in your Clerk dashboard.

4. **Setup Prisma:**

- Generate Prisma Client:

  ```bash
  npx prisma generate
  ```

- Run Database Migrations:
  ```bash
  npx prisma migrate dev --name init
  ```

5. **Run the Development Server:**

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Database Configuration

Ensure your cloud-based PostgreSQL database is configured and accessible. Create a new database using your preferred database management tool or CLI:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE healthcare_db or nay name;
```

Update the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file with your cloud-based PostgreSQL credentials.

---

## Clerk Configuration

1. Sign up for a [Clerk account](https://clerk.dev/).
2. Create a new Clerk project.
3. Copy the **Frontend API** and **API Keys** from your Clerk project settings.
4. Update the `.env` file with the following values:
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your clerk publishable key
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=clerk secrek key
   ```

## Prisma Setup

1. **Prisma Schema:**
   The Prisma schema is located in `prisma/schema.prisma`. You can update this file to define your database models and relationships.

2. **Migrate Database:**

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

3. **Prisma Studio:**
   To view and manage your database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```
